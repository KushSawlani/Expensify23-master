# Daily Expense Tracker - Expensify

Expensify is an mobile application used to keep a log on daily expense, split it between friends and roommates, so that everyone gets paid off. The application is developed in react-native framework. We have provided a better UI which helps user to view his dashboard with charts and graphs for better understanding.

- <b>Track Expenses</b> - Keep track of the expenses, balances and who owes who.
- <b>Organize Expenses</b> - Split expense with any group and get paid off.
- <b>Add Expense easily</b> - Add your daily new expense easily.

## Upcoming Improvements

We have thought some other features but it was not possible to implement in the time interval. But we will do it in future.

- <b>Notification Reading</b> - This feature will include sms reading from mobile Notification bar and with some conditions we will identify the amount debited and add it to the expense directly. We are using expo application in which notification reading is not possible, so we will shift our application to react native cli.
